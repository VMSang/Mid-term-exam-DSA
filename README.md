This repository contains the mid-term exam project for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of the fundamental concepts and techniques covered in the course curriculum.

The project consists of several programming tasks that assess my ability to implement various data structures and algorithms, as well as to analyze and solve real-world problems. The tasks cover a wide range of topics, including:
- Array-based data structures
- Linked lists
- Stacks and queues
- Trees and binary search trees
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Recursion and dynamic programming
